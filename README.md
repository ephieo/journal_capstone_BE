### Project Description :

#### Requirements

Build a full-stack journaling application with a twist.

- A user can add and delete multiple entries a day;
- A user can view the saved entries (the entries should be saved to a database);
- A user can view the quote of the day from an API of your choice above the entries;
- A user can save the quote of the day
- A user can view the saved quotes of the day.

In a technology of your choice, please prepare and present the UI design ideas (wireframes) to
the client on Slack, apply it according to their feedback.
The app should work locally, don’t deploy it.
The client has strict budgeting rules and the crafters can’t bill for additional features that weren’t
listed in the requirements above. Please fill the timesheet with the tasks that you’ve completed
as you progress through.
If in doubt about the scope of the project, reach out to the client on Slack.

#### Stack

- Python backend
- GraphQL
- React frontend

The remaining stack is at your discretion. Pick the web framework, GraphQL support (if needed)
and database technology. Feel free to use any additional libraries eg. components libraries.
